    "### What are functions?\n",
    "A function is used to perform a task based on a particular input. Functions are the bread and butter of any programming language. We have used many functions already that are builtin to the objects we have interacted with. For example, we saw that `string` objects have functions to capitalize letters, or add spacing, or query their length. Similarly, `list` objects have functions to search for elements in them, or to sort. The next step in our journey to begin writing our own functions. This is only an introduction, as we will continue over time to learn many new ways to write more and more advanced functions.  "

The idea is, you can either write your program to first try to do something and only bother handling exceptions when you get caught with an error, or, alternatively you can write your code to check that everything is properly formatted and no errors will be raise before it tries to execute any code. In general, the `EAFP` (ask forgiveness after getting caught) method is preferable, but both are typically used frequently in any program. "

We use a statement called a `try/except` statement. The indentation of the code is important in this part, if a TypeError is raised anywhere within the indented `try` section then it will be caught by the `except` clause.
