# 3-Python-basics


### Notebooks
We will begin running jupyter notebooks in the `Notebooks` directory in class.
There are five notebooks, two of which, 3.3 and 3.4, have challenges in them
that you need to complete for your assignment. When finished, make a copy of
these notebooks (e.g., using the `cp` bash command) and put a copy in the
`Assignment/` directory, to indicate that you have completed it.

### Lecture
This directory includes a PDF copy of Lecture 3

### Assignment
You will copy and push your finished assignment here.

### Code-review
You will push your code reviews here
